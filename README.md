--- Description ---
Distance preserving pseudonymization algorithm in the special case of time values (easily expandable for all kind of integers).
Implemented on base of the one dimensional algorithm provided by Florian Kerschbaum [1].
 
--- Requirements ---
- Testet on Python 2.7, would probably work for higher versions, too.
